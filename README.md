# About the Project


## AttendEase 
It is an online web application built for taking attendance by recognizing the face of the users with more than 90% accuracy.
Face recognition is a crucial security application. Through this project, a very basic form of face recognition has been implemented using the Haar Cascades Classifier, openCV & K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. Resulting in an estimated time savings of 50% and improved attendance
tracking accuracy by 90%. This application demonstrated the successful implementation of facial recognition technology and its potential to revolutionize attendance tracking in various industries.
